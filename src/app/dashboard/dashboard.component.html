          </mat-card-title>
        </mat-card-header>
        <mat-card-content class="dashboard-card-content">
          <p>This site is meant to demonstrate some of my skills and experience throughout the entire software
            lifecycle.</p>
          <p>The site itself is the result of an <a href="https://angular.dev" target="_blank">Angular</a> application
            that is built, tested,
            packaged and deployed
            into a hosting environment completely with <i>CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery)</i>
            automation.
            The source code for the project
            is hosted as a public github repository <a href="https://github.com/invinity/mattpitts-site" target="_blank">here</a>
          </p>
          <h3>Realtime Rendered Resume</h3>
          <p>This site also contains a component to render my personal resume as a web page using live information from
            my LinkedIn profile. This is accomplished using <a
              href="https://github.com/invinity/linkedin-profile-grabber" target="_blank">another project</a>, written in Golang, that
            provides a simple
            API to retrieve my Linkedin profile as JSON.
            This it allows myself, or anyone else, to view a formatted resume that is always up-to-date with my LinkedIn
            profile.
          </p>

          <h3>Fully Automated Build, Test, Deploy</h3>
          <p>
            This Angular project backing this site has fully-automated CI/CD using <a
              href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions" target="_blank">GitHub Actions</a>. The steps are defined in a
            <i>workflows</i> file contained
            within the project's source and are executed each time there is a push to the <code>main</code> branch of
            the project. This means that any change to the project that is pushed or merged onto
            the project's default <code>git</code> branch is automatically executed in the CI/CD pipeline and the
            application is re-deployed into is hosting environment.
          </p>

          <p>
            In addition, the <a href="https://github.com/invinity/linkedin-profile-grabber" target="_blank">Golang
              project</a> providing the Linkedin profile API also has fully-automated CI/CD. But
            instead of Github Actions,
            this project is using <a href="https://cloud.google.com/build?hl=en" target="_blank">Google Cloud Build</a>
            to automatically pickup any commits to the Github repository and perform CI/CD automation.
            This includes the construction of a <i>Docker</i> images for the Golang project and the deployment of this
            image into <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run?hl=en" target="_blank">Google Cloud Run</a> for hosting.
          </p>

          <h3>Hosting of this site</h3>
          <p>
            The Angular application for this site is hosted as a static website within an AWS (Amazon Web Services) S3
            bucket. The bucket is
            configured to allow serving of the files within it as a static website.
          </p>

          <p>For the <i>Golang</i> project providing the Linkedin profile data for myself, it is deployed as a Docker
            container into <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run?hl=en" target="_blank">Google Cloud Run</a>
          </p>
