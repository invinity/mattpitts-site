          </mat-card-title>
        </mat-card-header>
        <mat-card-content class="dashboard-card-content">
          <p>This site is meant to demonstrate some of my skills and experience throughout the entire software
            lifecycle.</p>
          <p>The site is an <a href="https://angular.dev" target="_blank">Angular</a> application that is built, tested,
            packaged and deployed
            into a hosting environment completely with CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) automation.
            The source code for the project
            is hosted as a public github repository.
          </p>
          <h3>Realtime Rendered Resume</h3>
          <p>This site also contains a component to render my personal resume as a web page using live information from
            my LinkedIn profile. This is accomplished using the LinkedIn API and it allows myself, or anyone else, to
            view
            a nicely styled resume that is always up-to-date with my LinkedIn profile. This provides a practical
            solution to
            having a resume readily available for download and also
            serves as a demonstration my experience
            working with <i>APIs</i> and related technologies like <i>OAuth authentication</i>.
          </p>

          <h3>Fully Automated Build, Test, Deploy</h3>
          <p>
            This application's CI/CD is automated using <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions"
              target="_blank">GitHub Actions</a>. The steps are defined in a <i>workflows</i> file contained
            within the project's source and are executed each time there is a push to the <code>main</code> branch of
            the project. This means that any change to the project that is pushed or merged onto
            the project's default <code>git</code> branch is automatically executed in the CI/CD pipeline and the
            application is re-deployed into is hosting environment.
          </p>

          <h3>Hosting</h3>
          <p>
            This application is hosted as a static website within an AWS (Amazon Web Services) S3 bucket. The bucket is
            configured to allow serving of the files within it as a static website.
